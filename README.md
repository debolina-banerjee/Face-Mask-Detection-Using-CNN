# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN
Here is the implementation of Face Mask Detection using the Convolution Neural Network. This project will detect face with a mask or without mask. If the mask is on the face then it’ll give a result “Mask” and if the mask is not on the face then it’ll give “No Mask”. 

The project has been splitted into two parts:

You can check with a single image. If you give an image of faces to a model, then it’ll classify whether that person wears a mask or not.
When you run the program then the camera will be open and model start classifying your face in real time.

Our Custom CNN architecture Model training accuracy reached 95% and Validation accuracy reached 96%.
